Public release of LyX version 1.3.1
===================================

We are glad to announce the release of LyX 1.3.1.

As expected this is a maintenance release, which adds some polish
to the new features of LyX 1.3.0 (especially the Qt frontend) and also
fixes some significant bugs in the math editor and the lyx2lyx import
script. We also threw in a few new features (new textclasses, latex
import improvements) for good measure.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

  LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an
  approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
  appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of 
  visual layout to the software.

  LyX runs on many Unix platforms (including MacOS X), OS/2, and under
  Windows/Cygwin. Note that all these ports still need an X server.

You can download LyX 1.3.1 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files) :

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.1.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.1.tar.bz2

and it should shortly propagate to the following mirrors (also with
the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.1.tar.gz

        ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm0/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.1.tar.gz


Prebuild binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be 
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.1/

first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/, and e-mail the LyX users' list 
(lyx-users@lists.lyx.org) if you can't find an answer there.
