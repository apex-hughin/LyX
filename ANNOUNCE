Public release of LyX version 1.6.3
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.3. This is the third
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series. Besides the usual improvements
of stability, the highlights of this release are:

* tex2lyx is now able to read files in all latex supported encodings and
  transform them into the proper unicode-based format introduced in 1.5.0.
  This paves the way for many other improvements in LaTeX->LyX translation
* The performance problems when editing a master with child documents have
  been resolved.
* LyX 1.6.3 introduces some goodies provided by Qt 4.5 (menu support for 
  fullscreen mode in linux, close button on tabs). Of course these
  improvements (as well as some Qt-related fixes) only show up if LyX is
  compiled against Qt 4.5.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.3 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.3.tar.bz2

	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.3.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

- New Indonesian translation of the Introduction and Tutorial manual.

- New French translation of LyX's list of defined shortcuts.

- New Japanese translation of the Math and Braille manual.

- Updated German, Czech, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish,
  Romanian, Turkish, and Ukrainian localization of the user interface.

- Updated English Extended manual.

- Updated English, French, German, Norwegian, and Spanish Introduction
  manual.

- Updated English, French, German, and Spanish Math and User's Guide
  manual.
  
- Updated Japanese User Guide and LaTeX Configuration manual.

- Updated English, German, and Spanish Customization manual.

- Updated Spanish Shortcuts list.

- Added documentation about the reverse DVI search feature in LyX
  to the Additional Features manual.

- Updated the achemso.lyx example file for version 3.2 of the achemso
  LaTeX-package.


* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- tex2lyx is now able to read files in all latex supported encodings and
  transform them into the proper unicode-based format introduced in 1.5.0.
  This paves the way for many other improvements in LaTeX->LyX translation
  (bugs 3035, 4379, 4917).

- Quotes in InsetListings are now plain quotes, rather than InsetQuote
  entries (bug 5782).

- Improved re-import from LaTeX of documents containing unadorned unicode
  symbols in math.

- Using the AMS \text macro now only requires the amstext package and not
  the full amsmath package. The amstext package is also loaded when using
  other text-in-math environments in order to get the correct size for
  text super and subscripts.

- KDE 4's okular is considered as a viewer for PDF, PS and DVI.

- Revert to pre-1.6 behaviour of always enclosing the preamble between
  \makeatletter and \makeatother when exporting to LaTeX and not only
  when the @-glyph explicitly appears.

- The new eLyXer converter is used for HTML output if available.


* USER INTERFACE

- Add jump-back navigation to the standard toolbar and to the menu
  (bug 898).

- Support for continued fractions (LaTeX-command \cfrac) in math/formulas
  (bug 2473).

- Store the command buffer history in the session file and show it in 
  a pop-up list in the command buffer.

- Added locking capabilities for SVN version control support.
  (Read the Additional Features manual for details.)

- Add Open/Close items to context menu of collapsable insets.

- LFUN_NEXT_BUFFER (Ctrl-PgUp) and LFUN_PREV_BUFFER (Ctrl-PgDn) now skip
  documents that are loaded but not displayed in a window. Such documents 
  are also shown in a sub-menu of the Document menu (Bug 5872).

- Added tooltips for citation insets.

- Non-ascii characters entered or pasted in math are now by default
  wrapped in a text-in-math environment. If desired, this can be avoided
  by verbatim pasting (Ctrl+Shift+V) or by dissolving the text inset.
  
- Zooming is bound to LFUN_BUFFER_ZOOM_IN and LFUN_BUFFER_ZOOM_OUT
  (next to ctrl+mousewheel), and the shortcuts M-plus (M-equal) and 
  M-minus are assigned to them (bug 3038).

- Reintroduce cross-referencing between independent files in the Reference
  dialog.

- Add visual and tooltip indication of activation status for branches.

- Added keyboard shortcuts for paragraph settings (Alt+A ...).

- Improved display of citation information by gathering missing data from
  the crossref field, as BibTeX does.
  
- Support the optional argument of \chapter* in the memoir class.

- Move the buffer-close button into each tabbar -- for Qt 4.5 (bug 3724).

- Support fullscreen menu under linux too -- for Qt 4.5 (bug 4888).



** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix reading of document when a customizable inset name contains a
  space.

- Fix bug when using the characters # and % in hyperlinks that are e.g.
  in footnotes (bug 5908).
  
- Fix reversion of aligned tables in subfloats to LyX 1.5 (bug 5918).

- Fix reversion of math and some other specific stuff in subfigure
  caption to LyX 1.5.
  
- Fix reversion of info insets with a backslash to LyX 1.5.

- Fix unicode characters > LaTeX macro reversion to LyX 1.5.

- Fix LaTeX export of an isolated Japanese character when using

  geometry option clash is avoided (bug 5863).

- Perform extra LaTeX run when requested by the French lettre class
  (bug 5818).

- Support LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (bug 5913). Note that only selected
  fonts provide this character. Others output <SS>.
  
- Autosave files of still unnamed documents (newfiles) are now saved
  in the backup dir, default document dir, or else in the temp dir.

- Make sure the autosave files are removed when a document is saved
  with a different filename or in a different location (bug 5879).

- Fix bug in LyX internal file handling that would have caused returning
  the listing of the parent directory if a directory path was specified
  without a trailing slash (only converters may have been affected).

- Fix crash that might happen when pressing a key while the cursor is not
  visible, thus requesting the view to be scrolled (bug 5888).

- Validate the input of Preferences>Output>Date Format and the argument
  of the date-insert function. This fixes a crash on Windows with invalid/
  unsupported date specifiers (bug 5827).

  and right margins (specified in the layout) will overlap (bug 5890).
  
- Fix crash when undoing the expansion of a user-defined macro is
  expanded in math after being finalized before (bug 5540).
  
- Fix the undo of info-insert, which caused a crash in math (bug 5930).

- Fix assertion with instant preview when nesting math in a text-in-math
  environment (bug 5392).
  
- Fix a bug where LyX ate a large preamble consisting of many non-Western
  characters (bug 5951).
