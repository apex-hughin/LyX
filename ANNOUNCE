Public release of LyX version 1.5.6
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.6. This is the fifth
maintenance release in the 1.5.x cycle that has been started exactly
one year ago. The aim of this release was to make LyX even more robust 
and to solve some long-standing annoyances. Also, further translation
efforts have been made, and LyX now ships in 23 languages.

All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

With this release, the LyX 1.5.x series reaches its peak, while the next
major milestone, LyX 1.6.0, is already in sight. Expect, however, at least
one more minor release in the 1.5.x series, which will be released in
parallel to 1.6.0 and which will be able to import LyX 1.6.x documents.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.6 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.6.tar.gz

	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.6.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):
