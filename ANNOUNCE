Public release of LyX version 2.0.2
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.2. This is the second
maintenance release in the 2.0.x series.

LyX 2.0.2 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. We encourage all
LyX users to upgrade to this version.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.0.2 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

If you think you found a bug in LyX 2.0.2, either e-mail the LyX
developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org), or open a bug
report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.0.2.

The LyX team.

What's new in LyX 2.0.2
=======================

There have been several improvements to LyX's ability to export documents
in the background, so the program does not freeze during compilation. We 
hope to continue these improvements throughout the 2.0.x series.

There have been major updates to the tex2lyx conversion script. Please see
below for the details.

The ctex document classes, used for Chinese documents, are now supported
by LyX.

Support for the Springer document classes has been updated for compatibility
with the lasest versions. This has the side-effect that files, created with 
LyX 2.0.2 or future, using a Springer document class, will not be compilable 
with LyX versions older than LyX 2.0.2. The same applies for files created
with LyX 1.6.10 or older that are saved with LyX 2.0.2 or future.
