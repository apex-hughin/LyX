Public release of LyX version 1.6.8
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.8. This is the 9th
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series.

LyX 1.6.8 is the result of our ongoing efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed crashes that have been
reported to us, ironed out many small glitches, further polished the user
interface, updated the documentation and added some new layouts.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

While our next major release, LyX 2.0, has just reached beta status and
already can be tried out by the curious and brave, LyX 1.6.8 is the
release for everyone who is relying on a solid and polished application.
We thus encourage all users to upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.8 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.8.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.8.tar.bz2

	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.6.8.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

What's new in version 1.6.8?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Add support for pBibTeX (formerly known as jBibTeX), a specific Japanese
  BibTeX variant (bug 6808).

- New environment variable LYX_FORCE_OVERWRITE allows changing default
  behavior when exporting from command line. Now LyX overwrites the main
  file by default, but not the ancillary files. Set this variable to
  "all" for letting LyX behave as in 1.6.6 and previous versions; set it
  to "none" for mimicking the 1.6.7 behavior of not overwriting any file.

- New layout and template file for submissions to journals published by
  the American Geophysical Union (AGU).

- New layout and template file for submissions to journals published by
  the Econometric Society (bug 6761).

- New layout and template file for the document class frletter that is
  used to write letters in French (bug 6915).

- New layout and template file for the document class lettre, another
  French letter class.

- Add support for subtitles in the KOMA classes.

- Add support for lists and quotes in the g-brief2 letter class
  (bug 6857).

- Add support for the math command \ddddot (part of bug 6872).


* USER INTERFACE

- Improve the detection of LaTeX warnings in the Log dialog.

- Citations in the outline now display the key (bug 6837).


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Introducing Serbian (Latin) localization of LyX: A large part of the
  user interface has been translated already.

- New Serbian (Latin) translation of the Splash document.

- Revised section 4.2 "Footnotes" of the EmbeddedObjects manual.

- Revised section 5.1 "Installing a new LaTeX package" of the
  Customization manual.

- Describe how to use formulas in program listings in sec. 7 of the
  EmbeddedObjects manual.

- Updated LaTeXConfig file.

- Updated English and German Linguistics manual.

- Updated French beamer template fr_beamer-conference-ornate-20min.

  Portuguese, Spanish, Slovak and Ukrainian User Interface localizations.

** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix a crash when dropping multiple files onto LyX (bug 6944).

- Fix a crash due to unrecognized \defskip (bug 7014).

- Assure that Japanese LaTeX (pLaTeX) is in fact only used for Japanese
  documents. This fixes major configuration problems with TeXLive 2010.

- Fix the output of glyph 0x02e0 (MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA) (bug 6817).

- Load the amsmath LaTeX-package when the math command \dddot is used to
  avoid LaTeX errors (bug 6872).

- Do not popup "invalid path" warning when using View > Source (bug 6904).

- Small tweaks to the memoir text class.

- Allow pathnames with commas for BibTeX files (bug 6914).

- Set correct anchor for the link to the bibliography in the table
  of contents if hyperref is used (bug 6470).

- Save the path of pasted images as a relative path (part of bug 5561).

- Don't escape math labels when saving (bug 7019).


* USER INTERFACE

- Do not allow to rename a format's short name if the format is used by a
  converter. This prevents a crash (bug 6815).

- Fix crash when mutating eqnarray-like environments with labeled lines
  to display equations (bug 6858).

- Disable cut and paste inside the Math Delimiters dialog. This was of no
  use and could trigger a crash (bug 6942).

- Fix a crash when editing a macro name under some circumstances (for
  example, when the macro is followed by a script inset and another
  macro) (bug 6965).

- Fix an assertion when unindenting empty lines in a listings inset
  (bug 6869).

- Box dialog: only shaded boxes can have multiple paragraphs if there
  is no inner box (fixes also bug 6992).

- Fix mouse wheel scrolling on Mac OS 10.6 (bug 6775).

- Fix tab-switching keyboard shortcut (bug 5970).

  text-mode user macros (bug 1337).

- When undo returns to a state where the file was saved, make sure to
  reset the (changed) status (bug 3733).

- Don't allow to insert margin notes and floats into tables because this
  would lead to LaTeX errors (bug 6844).

- Don't allow to insert margin notes and footnotes into captions because
  this would lead to LaTeX errors.

- Fix handling of commands containing a straight quote (") in shortcut
  editor (bug 6786).

- Use correct mode and screen fonts for old-style font changing macros
  (\bf, \cal, \it, \rm, and \tt) in math (bug 6851).

- Retain the first non-empty label when mutating eqnarray-like environments
  to a display equation (bug 6793).

- Load files in correct order when passed as arguments via the command
  line (bug 6848).

- Fix parsing of commands sent through the lyxserver, such that they don't
  need to be terminated by a newline character (bug 6868).

- Don't try to blindly execute the latex command if no latex binary is
  available (bug 6873).

- Fix button link assignment in "Select from Template" dialog.

- Don't mark document as changed when navigating with cell-forward
  or cell-backward.

- Correct check for enable condition of VC repository update.

- Correct enabled check for LFUN_MATH_NUMBER_TOGGLE.
  Avoid implicit conversion of enum to bool.

- Fix some accelerator conflicts in Document Class dialog (bug 6963).

- Do not warn any changes will be lost when reverting to the
  saved file if the document is clean (bug 6550).
