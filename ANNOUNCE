Public release of LyX version 1.6.6.1
=====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.6.1 This is the seventh
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series.

The sole purpose of this release is to fix one glitch that was introduced
by LyX 1.6.6: The spellchecker missed further misspellings after applying
a correction. This was due to the fix to different bug that had to be
reverted. In any other respect, this release is identical to Lyx 1.6.6.

A detailed list of changes in LyX 1.6.6 is appended below, remaining known
problems are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.6.1 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.6.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.6.1.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

What's new in version 1.6.6.1?
------------------------------

** Bug fixes:
*************

- Fix the spellchecker so that no misspellings are missed (bug 6708).
  For this, the fix to update correctly the toolbar after the spellchecker
  has made a replacement (bug 6217) had to be reverted.
  

What's new in version 1.6.6?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- LyX now supports SVG images when either the librsvg library or
  Inkscape (version 0.47 recommended) is installed (bug 3349).

  on the document language. (When importing e.g. a Spanish document,
  LyX will use comillas latinas as quotes.)

- Add support for Aspell language varieties. This enables proper support
  of German old and new spelling in parallel when "aspell (library)" is
  used (bug 4657).

- Add support for the enchant spellchecker (bug 6226). LyX needs to be
  compiled --with-enchant in order to use this feature.

  repository (part of bug 5211).

  beamer template file.
