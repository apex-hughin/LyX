Public release of LyX version 2.0.5.1
=====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.5.1. This is a service
update to 2.0.5.

The only change in LyX 2.0.5.1 is that we have returned to previous behavior
by loading the babel package even with English-only documents. The package
is really required only when languages other than English are used, but it
appears that there are several document classes (including the Komascript
letter class) that depend upon the earlier behavior. This fixes bug 8423.

The other changes that were included in 2.0.5 are listed below.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.0.5.1 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

If you think you found a bug in LyX 2.0.5.1, either e-mail the LyX
developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org), or open a bug
report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.0.5.1.

The LyX team.

What's new in LyX 2.0.5
=======================

The View>Source widget now allows you to select the backend to display,
e.g., LaTeX or XHTML, rather than the output format. The previous choice
really made no sense: You didn't see a PDF there if you chose one of the
PDF output formats, but rather LaTeX. This solves some long-standing issues
with View>Source.

There has been an important change in how the "language" lfun works.
  - "language <LANG>" now toggles between languages
    (status quo ante LyX 2.0.2)
  - "language <LANG> set" sets to language <LANG>
    (meaning of "language <LANG>" as of LyX 2.0.2)
  - "language [reset]" resets to the document language.
  - Menu functions are unchanged.
