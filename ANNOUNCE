Public release of LyX version 1.6.10
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.10. This is the 11th
and final maintenance release in the 1.6.x series.

LyX 1.6.10 concludes the successful 1.6 series, which has been our stable
series for the past two and a half years. The most notable new feature of
this version is that it is able to read and import documents of our new
stable series, LyX 2.0.x. This is for the benefit of users who want to
stick with LyX 1.6.x for the time being, but still want to cooperate with
users of the new version. Note that LyX 1.6.10 still writes the 1.6 format,
so it cannot produce (but only interpret) LyX 2.0's new features.

Read on below what has been changed and fixed in this version apart from that.
Remaining known problems are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

Anyone who intends to stick with the 1.6 series is strongly encouraged to
upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.10 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.10.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.10.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.6.10.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.6.10.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

	ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.10.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.10.tar.gz

	http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.10.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at:

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.6.10/

If you already have the sources of the previous release (1.6.8), you may
want to apply one of the following patches instead:

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/patch-1.6.10.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/patch-1.6.10.bz2

Note that for this release, some binaries have been added that are not produced
by the patch.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.6.10, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!
