Public release of LyX version 1.3.3
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.3.

This is a maintenance release which improves upon 1.3.2 in
four main areas:
  * import of old LyX files and export to DocBook have been improved;
  * many small bugs in the Qt frontend have been fixed;
  * MacOSX users can now compile LyX and enjoy the native MacOSX interface;
  * several languages now benefit from an improved translation of
    the user interface amd documentation.

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages
   an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents,
   not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving
   details of visual layout to the software.

   LyX runs on many Unix platforms, OS/2, and under Windows/Cygwin
   (this port requires an X server). It can also run natively on Mac
   OS X, thanks to the Qt/Mac library.

You can download LyX 1.3.3 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files) :

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.3.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.3.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.3.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.3.tar.gz

        ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm0/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.3.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.3/
