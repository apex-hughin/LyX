Public release of LyX version 1.3.6
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.6.

Unix and MacOSX users should consider this to be a bugfix release.

To Windows users, however, LyX 1.3.6 is the first version of LyX
to support the platform officially. This means that we've put a huge
effort into squashing those bugs that were present in Ruurd Reitsma's
unofficial ports to Windows. Large chunks of the code base have been
touched in an attempt to resolve these problems so whilst we're
confident that LyX/Win 1.3.6 will be the best ever version of LyX on
Windows, we cannot say that it's bug free.

We would like to highlight three fixes in particular:
  * It is now possible to typeset files which reside in a directory with
    spaces in its name; this requires a modern TeX implementation (such
    as teTeX 3.0).
  * It is possible to use Ctrl-PageDown and Control-PageUp (<cmd>-tab
    and <cmd>-backtab with Qt/Mac) to switch between the open documents.
  * LaTeX-type accents, ligature breaks and hyphenation marks are now
    considered as part of words 

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages
   an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents,
   not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving
   details of visual layout to the software.

   LyX was originally a Unix application, but now runs natively on
   Windows and Mac OS X as well, thanks largely to the cross-platform Qt
   toolkit.

You can download LyX 1.3.6 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.6.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.6/

If you already have the LyX 1.3.5 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.6.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.6.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Win sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.3.6, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel @ lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users @ lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.


What's new
==========

** Updates

- It is now possible to typeset files which reside in a directory with
  spaces in its name; this requires a modern TeX implementation (such
  as teTeX 3.0).

- Implement new functions buffer-next and buffer-previous that allow
  to cycle through open buffers; they are respectively bound to
  Ctrl-PageDown and Control-PageUp (except with mac bindings, where
  <cmd>-tab and <cmd>-backtab are used). [bugs 515 and 1639]

- LaTeX-type accents (which are used when converting from 7bit latex
  documents or when a given accented letter does not exist in the
  document encoding) are now considered as part of words; the same
  holds for ligature breaks and hyphenation marks. This impacts word
  level operation like selection by double-click or index entry
  defaults.

- The converters defined in the lyxrc.defaults and preferences files
  can now use a "$$s" placeholder to tell LyX to look for the
  converter in its support directories. A typical example is:

  \converter lyxpreview ppm "python $$s/scripts/lyxpreview2ppm.py" ""

- The ``annote'' field of BibTeX entries is now shown in citation preview.

- it is now possible to change current font to boldsymbol through the math
  panel. [Qt only]

- update the aastex textclass to AASTeX 5.2

- new Turkish translation.

- Files from the 1.4 development branch of LyX and tex2lyx can now be
  converted by lyx2lyx. The conversion is not perfect for all new features,
  but files containing only features supported by LyX 1.3.x can be converted
  back and forth without problems.

** Bug fixes

* Document input/output:

- Fix LaTeX output of percentage length values <10%. [bug 1523]

- Fix crash when reading equations containing more columns than
  allowed. [bug 1542]

- Allow reading math arrays with their options on a separate line
  (Scientific Word does that).

- Fix crash when inserting invalid length data. [bug 1682]

- Store typed '&' characters in math as '\&'. [bug 1542]

- Make sure that the amsmath package is used in LaTeX output when
  using the AMS-specific array environments, over/under arrows or the
  \text command in equations.

- Make sure that the wasysym package is used in LaTeX output when
  using symbols from the wasy font.

- Fix export via commandline of symbols using AMS or wasy fonts. [bug 1665]

- Make sure that the natbib and url packages are not loaded with
  REVTeX 4, since the functionality is already provided by the class.

- Fix output of mathbb and mathcal symbols via the math panel
  (XForms only). [bug 1214]

- Fix output of footnotes on the titlepage, which did not work with
  the memoir class. [bug 1677]

- Fix the LaTeX output of Short Titles (aka optional inset) that did
  not get \protect added when needed. [bug 1739]

- When reading an equation, don't parse \| following a \left or \right as |.

- Enable LaTeXConfig.lyx to be generated on Windows by fixing the line
  endings of the generated chkconfig.sed script.

- Fix positioning of error insets after graphics and external insets.

- When generating PDF, handle properly pdfTeX warnings. [bug 1824]

- Fix lyxpreview2ppm.py to work with python versions older than 2.1.

- Fix version control on files which name contains some special
  characters.

- Make lib/configure more portable, allowing it to run on Solaris.

- Remove detection of a PS interpreter in lib/configure, since we do
  not use it.

- Use ps2pdf13 to convert from PS to PDF (more portable).

- Remove from convertDefault.sh the test that "convert" really succeeded
  as it reported failures on Windows that were actually successes.
  See, eg, http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=lyx-users&m=110561697803860&w=2

- No longer quote the name of the external executable in lyxpreview2ppm.py.
  Windows didn't like that.

- Windows users are now able to define and use their own graphics converters
  because the command is now quoted correctly.

- Given a Windows-style path, don't forget to mangle the drive letter too when
  generating a unique temporary file name.

- LyX now passes all external scripts to the relevant interpreter explicitly.
  This means that Windows can now run the script even when it doesn't have
  a "recognized" file extension.

- Enable the file browser to return a "file name with spaces" to the
  appropriate dialog if LaTeX can handle such files.

- Squash the "Mutex destroy failure" warning when shutting down LyX [Qt only].
  Prevents a core dump on NetBSD.

* User Interface:

- Fix crash when using math-mutate with invalid argument.

- Implement support for qt-immodule. This fixes the dead key problems
  with some newer qt/x11 versions. [bug 1830]

- Fix math fonts display in LyX/Mac.

- Avoid automatic startup of the spellchecker when switching from one
  document to another. [bug 1451]

- fix wrong selection when opening the list of tables/figures dialog.
  [bug 1870] 

- Make LyX behave normally when a file has been opened from the
  Explorer. [Windows only]

- Windows users will find that graphics files are now converted to a
  "loadable" format asynchronously. That is, LyX will not block
  execution whilst graphics files are displayed on screen.

- Fix font metrics problems with Qt/Win 3.2.1.

- Fix bindings for depth-increment/decrement for LyX/Mac.

- Do not use the -swap option when viewing a Postscript file with gv,
  since newer versions do not support it. Users that see landscape
  documents upside-down should select 'swap landscape' in gv options.

- Semantic improvements in the Insert>Cross reference dialog.

- When showing a preview of a BibTeX entry in the Insert>Citation
  Reference dialog, handle \% correctly.

- The file browsers of the Qt versions of the External, BibTeX and
  Print dialogs now return a relative path if appropriate. [bug 1272]

- Fix display of citations when using 'et al.'

- fix translation of layout names with a space in their name.

- Fix left margins in various text classes.

- Fix server function server-get-tip. [bug 1781]

- Fix binding of Shift-Tab, which was broken on some systems.

- Enable the display of accented characters in the Help->About dialog.

- Fix "longtable" user interface in the tabular dialog. [bug 1061, Qt only]

- Remove the "child process" dialog, with which a user could kill child
  processes spawned by LyX. It was decided that this functionality belonged
  with the OS.

- Post convertDefault.sh's error messages to STDERR.

* Configuration/Installation:

- Enable XForms frontend to build with picky versions of 'make'.

- Fix link error with some compiler/OS combinations. [bug 1702]

- Fix link error with Cygwin.

- Fix warnings with recent versions of automake.

- Remove GNU-make specific construct in Makefile
