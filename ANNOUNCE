Public release of LyX version 1.5.4
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.4. This is a maintenance
release. Besides the usual stability improvements and fixes, this release
comes with major improvements in the handling of Chinese, Korean and
Japanese (CJK) languages and scripts, and introduces some minor new
features (such as a character count option).

While this release continues the stable 1.5.x series, work on the next
major release, 1.6.0, is proceeding. A first alpha version of LyX 1.6.0
will be released later this week for those who like the bleeding edge
experience. Notwithstanding this, expect one or two more 1.5.x versions
to be released, of which the last one will be able to read the 1.6 format.

All users, especially CJK users, are encouraged to upgrade to this 
version.

Caveat: We were forced to switch from the LaTeX package 'floatflt' to
'wrapfig' for wrap figure floats due to a license problem that limited
the availability of the former package. In general, this should improve
your documents containing wrap figures, however, it is possible that the
look and positioning of the floats changes due to the package change. If
you have documents with wrap floats, please make a backup before upgrading
and check the output.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.4 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.4.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
	http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/unix/editors/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz
        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.5.4.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.5.4/

If you already have the LyX 1.5.2 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.4.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.4.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.5.4, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.
