Public release of LyX version 1.4.3
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.4.3. This is a bug fix
release that improves stability and MS Windows support.
Notable new features include:

- The windows port does not need a MSys (unix-like tools) installation
  anymore.

- A new function inset-dissolve has been added to delete an text inset
  and put its contents in the enclosing text; this can be
  accessed (like in the math editor) by pressing Backspace at the
  start of an inset, or Delete at the end.

- Many crashes have been fixed, in particular for systems based on
  gcc 4.1.

See the file RELEASE-NOTES for some known problems in this release.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with page
   boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary
   TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output -- or
   richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks like
   nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs, all
   looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes 'eating'
   your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms. 

You can download LyX 1.4.3 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.3.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.4.3.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.4.3/

If you already have the LyX 1.4.2 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.3.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.3.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.4.3, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel  <at>  lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users  <at>  lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

What's new in version 1.4.3?
---------------------------- 

** Updates:

- All shell scripts have been translated to python so sh.exe is no
  longer needed. That's a big plus for the Windows port.

- Implement inset-dissolve feature; this can be accessed (like in
  mathed) by pressing Backspace at the start of an inset, or Delete at
  the end (bug 2201).

- Add buttons for \intop and \ointop to the math panel (bug 2698)

- Native support for \phantom, \hphantom and \vphantom in mathed (bug 1473).

- Some small updates to the documentation.

- Update Basque, Czech (new), French, German (bug 2718), Hungarian,
  Italian (bug 2774), NyNorsk and Spanish localizations.

  and Hungarian (new Tutorial) documentation.

  boost::bind library with gcc 4.1 (bug 2677, probably also 2662 and 2684).

  inset locking in mathed generally work (bug 2756).

  creation failed or the directory is not writeable(bug 2740).

  one element (like {a'}^{2}).

- On pressing button 2 in a math inset, paste the inner LyX selection
  if it exists (bug 2779).

- When inserting an inset (footnote etc.) over an existing selection,
  don't copy the layout of the source paragraph to the inset (bug 2802).

  /bin/bash (bug 2524).

- Set CPPFLAGS only if it not already set by the user
  (and ignore CXXFLAGS when setting CPPFLAGS).

- Handle properly gcc 4.1 in configure.

- Install python files together with precompiled versions.

- A scons build system has been added, for details please see
  INSTALL.scons. 'scons install' produces a cygwin-compatible binary
  package under cygwin.

- A CMake build system has been added, for details see
  development/cmake/README.cmake

- LyX can be compiled on windows with MSVC using qt3 from the Q../Free
  project and scons or CMake.

* Miscellaneous

- Do automatic reconfiguration even when running in batch mode (bug 2741).

- Change the encoding of some python scripts from iso-8859-15 to
  iso-8859-1. The former causes problems with embedded python.

  replaced by tex2LyX.
