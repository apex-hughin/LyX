Public release of LyX version 2.0.7
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.7. This is the seventh
maintenance release in the 2.0.x series.

LyX 2.0.7 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. 

The most important bug was #8854, which could lead to file corruption
in certain cases and, more often, would lead to errors in generated
files (e.g., PDFs). We encourage all LyX users to upgrade to this 
version.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.0.7 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org), or open a bug

documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
