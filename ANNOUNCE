Public release of LyX version 1.3.4
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.4.

This is a maintenance release which improves upon 1.3.3 in
five main areas:
  * It adds support for old files from LyX 0.10.x or 0.12.x;
  * Lyx documents can now be opened and edited even if
    they use text classes not present in your latex installation;
  * New Qt features have been added (improved selection,
    drag-and-drop);
  * Mac OS X support is much improved;
  * The interface and documentation localization have
    been polished.

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages
   an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents,
   not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving
   details of visual layout to the software.

   LyX runs on many Unix platforms, OS/2, and under Windows/Cygwin
   (this port requires an X server). It can also run natively on Mac
   OS X, thanks to the Qt/Mac library.

You can download LyX 1.3.4 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files) :

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.4.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz

        ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm0/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.4.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.4/

If you already have the LyX 1.3.3 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead

What's new
==========

** Updates

- it is now possible to open documents which use a textclass for
  which no LaTeX support is installed. The documents can be normally
  edited, but they can of course be neither previewed nor printed. Note
  that the format of the file .lyx/textclasses.lst has changed as a
  consequence and it is therefore not possible to use LyX 1.3.4 and an
  earlier version with the same .lyx/ directory.

- add support for drag-n-drop opening of lyx files from your favourite
  file manager [Qt only]

- add support for intelligent scrolling with the mouse cursor [Qt only]

- improvements in LyX/Mac: support for opening files with LyX in
  finder; the LyX.app bundle can now be moved around and is
  self-contained with its own fonts (for math equations), support
  files, and PATH

- add support for \boldsymbol in the math editor

- enable lyx to read documents from versions 0.10 and 0.12

- improve support for LaTeX documentclasses: new agums (generic style
  for first-time submissions to AGU editors) and g-brief2 (a nice
  letter class) textclasses; allow optional arguments in Author,
  AuthorAdress and Thanks styles for the elsart layout; add
  Affiliation layout to jgrga textclass

- improve documentation for some languages: basque (new Extended
  Manual and User Guide; updated Intro and Tutorial), german
  (updated User Guide) and norwegian (new Intro)

- update basque, danish, finnish, french, german, italian, nynorsk,
  romanian, spanish and slovenian interface localizations

- remove localization for the following languages, since they were too
  incomplete to be useful: bulgarian, catalan, czech, hebrew,
  hungarian, portuguese, swedish, turkish, walloon


** Bug fixes

- fix a security problem where an evil .lyx file could cause
  arbitrary commands to be executed during processing

- fix a crash when saving a file containing a table (only with some
  compilers) [Bug #1415]

- fix a crash in the math editor when selecting up/down close to
  subscript insets

- several fixes related to old files: silence a bogus warning about
  encoding; fix conversion of tables (out of range error)

- fix warnings for docbook counters

- enable the file dialog to open files with non-latin filenames [Qt only]

- allow the use of some paper sizes (A3, B3, B4, and custom) without
  custom margins [Qt problem only]

- fix a bug where changing the height unit in the graphics dialog did not
  activate the ok/apply buttons [bug #1469, Qt only]

- fix a bug where some menu entries did not show the corresponding
  keyboard binding [bug #1350, Qt only]

- fix the language of the russian table of contents of the documentation

- remove non-ascii characters from translatable strings. This
  simplifies the work of translators

- output useful info on receipt of LFUN_GETLAYOUT.

- add debug output if unable to open an ofstream to output the graphics
  conversion script.

- add debug output if unable to open preferences.xform for read/write.

- add a couple of forgotten MacOSX-related files

- a better fix for badly placed math symbols with LyX/Mac

- fix installation when program "makepsres" is not available on the
  path [bug #1479]

- compilation fixes for MacOSX

- fix (some) problems when compiling with a non-GNU make program

- enable lyx to compile on Itanium machines

- add autoconf 2.59 as a supported version
