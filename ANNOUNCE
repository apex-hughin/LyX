Public release of LyX version 1.5.1
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.1. It includes a
few bug fixes and, more importantly, fixes a bug where files produced
with the Document>Compressed option on would be malformed on windows.
It was therefore decided to revert to the trusty 1.4.x code in this
area and really 1.5.1 sooner than anticipated.

All 1.5.0 users are urged to upgrade to 1.5.1.

See the file RELEASE-NOTES for some known problems in this release.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.1 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.1.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
	http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/unix/editors/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz
        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.5.1.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.5.1/

If you already have the LyX 1.4.4 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.1.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.1.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.5.1, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

What's new in version 1.5.1?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Add template for the APA class (bug 2390).


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix output of LyX files on windodz when Document>Compressed is set.
  This is a dataloss bug that was the main reason for releasing 1.5.1
  now.

- Get rid of annoying LaTeX error after changing the document language
  (bug 2468).

* USER INTERFACE:

- Fix redrawing artefacts when switching tabs (bug 3969).

- Fix bug where using pdfsync marks the document 'changed' (bug 4023).

- Coherent behaviour when inserting over a selection: now the selection
  is always replaced by the insertion (bug 672).

- When inserting an URL over selected text, insert the selected
  text in the URL inset (bug 683).

- Don't allow invalid listings parameters to be passed when
  updating other controls in listings-related dialogs (bug 4053).

- Fix bug with math-matrix dialog always producing 1x1 matrices on
  platforms lacking proper support for wide characters (bug 4076).

- Sort colors in the Preferences dialog (bug 2571).


* DOCUMENTATION


* BUILD/INSTALLATION:

- scons now accepts SConstruct file from top source directory, which
  can be a symbolic link to development/scons/SConstruct.

- LyX configuration script now checks for htlatex as an OpenDocument
  converter, since some platforms have htlatex but not oolatex. It also
  checks for oowriter as an OpenDocument viewer and editor.
