Public release of LyX version 1.3.2
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.2.

This is a maintenance release which improves upon 1.3.1 in
three main areas:
  * the spellchecker code has been overhauled and many bugs 
    have been squashed;
  * many small bugs in the Qt frontend have been fixed;
  * several languages now benefit from an improved translation of 
    the user interface.

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message. There have been bug fixes to the xforms frontend also,
but most of these have been made to xforms itself. To benefit you must
recompile LyX against xforms 1.0.2 or greater which is currently
available only from CVS on the new xforms development site
http://www.nongnu.org/xforms/. Note that that is _compile_ aginst the
new xforms, not _link_ against a new version of the library, as the
work-arounds will otherwise still be in place. Note also that
development of xforms is currently accelerating. We hope to have an
official xforms release soon that will cure many of the small 
annoyances from which LyX currently suffers.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

  LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an
  approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
  appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of 
  visual layout to the software.

  LyX runs on many Unix platforms (including MacOS X), OS/2, and under
  Windows/Cygwin. Note that all these ports still need an X server.

You can download LyX 1.3.2 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files) :

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.2.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.2.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.2.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.2.tar.bz2

and it should shortly propagate to the following mirrors (also with
the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.2.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.2.tar.gz

        ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm0/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.2.tar.gz


Prebuild binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be 
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.2/

following patch instead
