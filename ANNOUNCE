Public release of LyX version 1.6.4.1
=====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.4.1. This is a small
update to LyX 1.6.4, which was the fourth maintenance release in the 1.6.x
series.

The only change over release 1.6.4 is the fix of a regression on the Mac,
which made some dialogs (such as Preferences and About LyX) unaccessible
via the menu. Other platforms than the Mac were not affected by the issue.

A detailed list of changes in 1.6.4 and 1.6.4.1 is appended below, 
remaining known problems are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

All Mac users are encouraged to upgrade to this version. For users of
other platforms, there's no reason to upgrade from LyX 1.6.4.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.4.1 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.4.1.tar.gz

What's new in version 1.6.4.1?
------------------------------

** Bug fixes:
*************

* USER INTERFACE

- Revert an erroneous bugfix that was introduced with LyX 1.6.4:
  "Disable some menu entries when the document windows does not have
  focus on OS X (bug 1720)."
  This re-enables the access to the Preferences and About LyX dialogs on
  the Mac menu (other platforms were not affected).


What's new in version 1.6.4?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- LaTeX import (tex2lyx) was updated and now also supports:
  * nomenclature entries
  * the LaTeX-package esint
  * the alternative LaTeX document language names "portuguese" and
    "brazilian"

- Implement separate chains for Japanese bibliography and index
  compilation. This allows for proper support for jbibtex and mendex,
  pLaTeX's bibtex and makeindex replacements (bug 5601).

- Lyx now recognizes dviout as DVI viewer (bug 6103).


* USER INTERFACE

- Support for chemical formulae via the LaTeX package mhchem. For a
  description see LyX's Math manual.

- LyX's warning about different textclasses in master and child now has a
  "Do not show this warning again!" checkbox. Checking it will disable the
  warning for this specific master/child constellation over sessions
  (bug 3218).

- Tooltips for toolbar buttons now show the main shortcut associated
  to the action.

- Tooltips for footnotes and some other insets now wrap, so they can
  actually be seen.

- New commands inset-begin/end (bound to Ctrl-Alt-Home/End) allow to jump
  to begin/end of insets (and outside of the inset if the cursor is
  already in place). There are also versions that select text.

- The LaTeX Log File dialog has a search facility.

- The notes context menu has a new item for toggling all notes.

- The math context menu has a new item for numbering a single line in a
  formula.

- The math context menu has now a status flag indicating the type of
  equation.

- Some context menu items haven been stylistically revised.

- The include inset context menu indicates the selected inclusion type.

- Add a graphical user interface for the SVN file locking property.

- Preferences about automatic popup and inline completion are now honoured
  when pressing Ctrl-L in math mode.

- Make it possible to copy from a deleted section (bug 5390).

- The merge changes dialog has a new button for backwards navigation
  (bug 2213).

- Copy as Reference is now also implemented for equation labels
  (bug 5948).

- Visual support for the integral signs \fint and \fintop in formulas was
  added.


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- New Slovakian translation of the Introduction manual.

- New French translation of the specific manual "How to write Braille
  with LyX".

- Updated Czech, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, 
  Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian and
  Spanish localizations of the user interface.

- Updated EmbeddedObjects manual: New section about subfloats.

- English Extended manual: Updated section about reverse DVI search.

- Updated English Additional Features manual.

- Updated Intro manual for all languages.

- Updated English, French, German, and Spanish Math manual.

- Updated German and Spanish User's Guide.

- Updated German and Japanese Tutorial.


* BUILD/INSTALLATION

- Added a shell script (lyxeditor) for performing reverse DVI/PDF search
  and a python script (lyxpak.py) for creating archives of a lyx file and
  all its ancillary files (graphics and so on) to development/tools.

- Take advantage of some bugfixes in Qt 4.5 for internal file handling.

- Added some cygwin-specific scripts and utility programs that are
  compiled and installed when building on cygwin.


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Prevent data loss when shutting down Windows (part of bug 5525).

- Fix conversion of documents from LyX 1.5 with multiple URL insets
  (bug 6121).

- Fix conversion documents from LyX 1.4 which have multicolumn cells in
  tabulars with expert border settings (bug 6018).

- Partially resolve bug 5702, "tex2lyx cannot deal with modules". We
  now treat the "DefaultModule" tag as if it were an "Input" tag. This
  is not a general solution, but does deal with one of the most serious
  cases of the bug.

- Fix language settings after an environment (bug 5096).

- Fix layout conversion problem with AMS classes (bug 6140).

- Fix the output of spaces that are at the beginning of a block with
  a new textcolor (bug 4473).

- Fix output of alignment if default aligment is not justified (bug 5995).

- Fix problem where updates in some child documents were not recognized
  and no LaTeX update was performed (bug 6024).

- The default eLyXer configuration now handles images correctly on view
  and export (requires eLyXer >= 0.27).

- Fix loading of UTF-8 encoded files when a byte order mark (BOM) is
  present (bug 6030).

- Fix reverse DVI/PDF search with child documents (bug 6020).

- Assure that a longtable caption is in a first header even if the table
  does not have one. This assures the caption is not repeated after a
  page break and consequently in the list of tables (bug 6057).

- The file encoding is now properly restored after a LaTeX environment
  or command with local scope (bug 5690).

- Enable the possibility to read documents from a path containing a
  $-character (bug 4177).

- Enable document margin settings and hyperref settings in the
  article (beamer) class.

- Fix bug involving incorrect requests to overwrite external files
  (bug 5522).

- Fix occasional wrong occurrence of theorem style (bug 6036).

- Fix the on-screen representation of headings in the AMS article and
  AMS book classes.
  

* USER INTERFACE

- Prevent a crash in Qt when scaling images on screen. This could occur
  only for certain scaling factors and image sizes (bug 5957).

- Do not close hidden documents that have unsaved changes without asking
  whether the changes should be saved (part of bug 5863).

- Fix bookmark navigation crash when multiple windows are used
  (bug 6000).

- Disable the "sort" option in the outliner for the Table of Contents
  which triggered a crash (bug 5983). Sorting the TOC didn't work anyway.

- Fix a crash when closing a LyX window with split views (bug 5998).

- Fix a crash when applying preference changes (bug 6064).

- Fix a crash when accessing the Navigate menu after an empty inset has
  been dissolved (bug 6003).

  (bug 6116).
  
- Fix a crash when navigating in a table with math insets (bug 6158).
  
- Fix a crash when closing LyX while a master and its child were open.

- Fix a crash when documents were hidden, the view was closed, and 
  the same documents were made visible in another view (bug 6162).

- Fix communication between lyxclient and server, which leads to a
  crash once CTRL+D is used on the client side (bug 6106).
  
- Display the filename suffix in the tab header if it is non-standard
  (e.g. ".lyx15"). This avoids a crash when loading two files with
  identical names but different extensions (bug 5646), and disambiguates
  such files in the user interface.

- Disable Symbols dialog for read-only documents. This prevents a
  potential crash.
  
- Fall back to default UI file if the specified one cannot be found
  (bug 6076).

- Fix assertion when a nested math hull appears in a math macro
  (bug 5996).
  
- Fix assertion when pressing down arrow in the command buffer while
  the history is empty (bug 6001).

- Fix assertion when selecting with Shift-button in math editor (bugs
  5046 and 6026).

- Fix assertion when starting spellchecker in math mode and clicking 
  "replace" (bug 6013)
  
- Fix assertion in mathed when moving the cursor immediately after
  pressing Ctrl-L (or '\' with inline completion disabled) in front of
  another character (bug 6063).
  
- Prevent a window resize when applying the Preferences when the 
  LyX window is maximized (bug 6034).

- Fix the upward scrolling when selecting with the mouse (bug 4464).

- Make Tools>Statistics ignore Note insets and inactive branches
  (bug 2566).

- Take into account file system case sensitivity when checking whether
  a path starts with a given prefix. This fixes a bug with reverse PDF
  search when using SumatraPDF as a PDF viewer on Cygwin.

- Fix the maximum number of the files stored in last-opened-files list
  (bug 5980).

- Disable unused functions in the citation dialog (bug 5987).

- Fix display of BibTeX entries in the info field of the citation
  dialog by only converting text mode latex macros to unicode glyphs.
  
- Convert LaTeX macros such as \"{u} to proper unicode characters
  for the display of authors/editors on the citation inset button.

- Fix pop-up of ToC and Source code panels after fresh install (part
  of bug 5082).

- Maintain session settings over version changes (also related to
  bug 5082).

- Do not reset toolbar settings after a change of UI files that do not
  concern toolbars.

- Fix math-insert lfun behaviour in the absence of a selection or when
  something outside mathed is selected (bug 6033).
  
- Fix casing inconsistencies in the English user interface.

- Fix context menu for insets inside a branch inset (bug 6022).

- Fix command "tabular-feature align-(left|right|center)" which was
  inadvertently disabled for a math matrix (bug 6041).

- Ensure that pasting into the preamble and the nomenclature dialog's
  description widget resets the font formatting (bug 3936).

- Fix wrong labeling as "child only" branch if branches were unknown.

- Fix typesetting of chemical equations by adding support for the mhchem
  package (bugs 6047, 4043, and 5394).

- Fix display of unknown math macros that become known after editing their
  name. They are now correctly expanded and not left in red (bug 5923).

- Fix display of macros when clicking away (bug 3706).

- Fix the inconsistent behaviour of the cursor inside math (bug 2034).

- Fix the toggling of the outline-button on the toolbar when closing
  the outliner with the 'x' (bug 3918).

- Fix the pasting of multiple cells in a table when a range is selected
  (bug 4952).

- Do not open files during startup that were closed in the previous
  session by Close View or Close Window (bug 5458).

- Remove empty paragraphs and superfluous spaces when leaving an inset
  (bug 5435).

- Fix the scrolling problem that when scrolling with PgUp or PgDn, the
  cursor could end up on a row that is only partly visible. This causes
  the cursor to end up somewhere else when scrolling back (bug 5944).

- Fix selection of math insets on some archs.

- Fix of painter glitches caused by uninitialized variables (bug 6077).

- Fix uninitialized variable in Dialog code (bug 6081).
