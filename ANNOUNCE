Public release of LyX version 1.5.3
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.3. This is a maintenance
release that further improves the stability and the performance. Besides
numerous crashes, the display problems that slipped into 1.5.2 with 
the performance fixes (on the Mac and on Windows) as well as problems 
entailed to the reworked document classes were fixed. Furthermore, LyX 1.5.3
comes with speed improvements that should pay off especially on the Mac and
other UNIXes. Finally, this version also provides some new features.

A detailed list of changes is appended below.

All users, especially the Mac and Windows users, are encouraged to upgrade
to this version.

The file RELEASE-NOTES lists some remaining known problems.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.3 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.3.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.5.3.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.5.3/

If you already have the LyX 1.5.2 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.3.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.3.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.5.3, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

What's new in version 1.5.3?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Updated Czech, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese,
  Norwegian, Spanish and Traditional Chinese translations of the user
  interface.

- New Spanish translation of the example file "ItemizeBullets.lyx".

- New French translation of the EmbeddedObjects manual.

- Updated French introduction manual and User's Guide.

- Revised Tutorial


* USER INTERFACE

- The way collapsable insets (footnotes, comments etc) are widened has
  seen a complete overhaul in order to speedup painting when typing
  within insets. Now these insets take the whole screen width as soon
  as they contain more than one row of text. Users of Mac/PPC and of
  Unices with slow X11 server should feel a significant boost in
  performance thanks to this change.

- The pixmap cache that was introduced in LyX 1.5.2 to improve performance
  can now be switched on and off in Preferences, since it might decrease
  on-screen display quality of fonts (subpixel hinting). By default, the
  cache is disabled. If you experience performance problems, turn in on
  (Mac and Windows only).

- The behaviour of Return and M-Return has changed: they now allow to either
  keep current paragraph and depth or to nesting paragraph (bug 2445).

- Add the esint font to the private math fonts. This font assures a
  consistent on screen looking for all kinds of supported integral signs.

- The slides/foils of presentation classes such as beamer, powerdot, foils
  and slides are now displayed in the outliner. This makes it easy to navigate
  to specific slides or move them up and down (bug 78).

- It is now possible to enter greek and cyrillic characters and have them
  typeset without switching to the proper language.

- Add native Erlang support for listings (bug 4263).

- The on-screen representation of charstyle insets has been polished:
  they now integrate better in the line. Furthermore, their label is
  not displayed anymore by default (it can be toggled globally by
  "View->Open all Insets" and individually by clicking the right mouse
  button). As a new type of information, the type of a charstyle inset
  is now displayed in the status bar when the mouse hovers over it.

- Inset-dissolve now works in mathed.

- Placeholders have been moved from the miscellaneous to the spacings section
  in the math toolbar.


* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- tex2lyx now imports the following LaTeX commands and environments:
  - \newline
  - environments "framed" and "shaded" from package framed.sty (i.e. framed
    and shaded notes in LyX)
  - \selectlanguage, \foreignlanguage, and \inputencoding (bug 27).
  - all font settings that are natively supported by LyX.
  - all quotation marks (bug 2703).

- xdg-open and sensible-editor are now detected as possible viewer (wrappers).
