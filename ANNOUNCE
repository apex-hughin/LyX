Public release of LyX version 1.5.5
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.5. Being the fourth
maintenance release in the 1.5.x cycle, this release further improves
the stability and usability of the application. Besides this, it also
introduces some new features.

Most notably, LyX is now prepared to be compiled with Qt 4.4 that has
just been released: the stability issues that occured in previous
versions of LyX when compiled against Qt 4.4 have been resolved.

All users, especially users of Qt 4.4, are encouraged to upgrade to
this version.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.5 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.5.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
	http://sunsite.icm.edu.pl/pub/unix/editors/lyx/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz
        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.5.5.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.5.5/

If you already have the sources of the previous release, you may want to apply
one of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.5.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.5.5.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.5.5, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix LaTeX import of aligned consecutive paragraphs (bug 4806).

- Fix font size handling when importing LaTeX files (bug 4803 and
  bug 4807).

- After an inset, don't always revert to the language's default encoding
  for latex output, but honor that specified in the document settings
  (bug 4665).

- Close font macros (such as \emph) before comments, greyedout, framed
  and shaded notes, thus fixing a problem where documents couldn't be
  compiled anymore.

- Fix LaTeX error "unknown color 'ignore'" when setting text style
  attributes in mathed (bug 4091).

- Assure amsthm is loaded if a theorem is defined with \theoremstyle.

- Fix LaTeX errors triggered by switching from ams article to ams plain
  article.

- Fix drawing of top and bottom rules in formal tables (bug 4554).

- Fix reversion of OHM and ANGSTROM characters to LyX < 1.5.0 (rest of
  bug 3313).

- Check for the LaTeX packages "nicefrac" and "units" that are used by
  LyX.

- Check for PDF->PS, PDF->EPS and PS->EPS converters and use them (bug
  3968).

- Stop warning messages when a local layout file is opened. Fix bugs
  caused by incorrect reloading of local layout files.

- Use verbose htlatex command instead of oolatex, if available, since the
  latter caused problems on some systems (bug 4604).

- Use package amsbsy for bold math symbols obtained through the \boldsymbol
  macro, such that bold super and subscripts have the correct size even
  when not using the complete amsmath package.

- Fix loading of lyx documents generated with csv2lyx (bug 4639).

- Move \label{} outside of listings option caption={} because the listings
  package prefers a separate label={} option.

- Set the correct encoding when an ASCII encoded LaTeX file is imported
  (bug 4719).

- Parse the command \makebox correctly when importing LaTeX files
  (bug 2504).

- Import global paragraph settings correctly when importing LaTeX files
  (bug 4773).

- Use style guide-conforming headings in the APA layout (bug 4827).


* USER INTERFACE:

  inserted in the advanced input of the listings dialog (bug 4780).

- Fix an assertion with compressed image files that do not have a
  zip-extension.

- Fix an assertion with incorrect argument for '-sysdir' command-line
  switch (bug 4791).

  delete key (bug 2556).

  paragraph selection.

- Correctly handle quotation marks in command preferences (bug 2016).

- Remove the menu entries to swap rows/columns as this feature is not
  implemented.

- Fix wrong focusing of buttons in search dialog (bug 4194).

- Disallow some Note variants in places where they would result in LaTeX
  errors (part of bug 4180).

- Use *.* to select all files in the file selection dialog on Windows.
  Using shortcuts for navigation is now possible.

- Fix \Vert symbol in the math panel (part of bug 4720).

- correct numbering inside multiline environments (bug 518).

- Fix typo in the script TeXFiles.py that scans for TeX files.

- Remove the menu entry Insert -> Math -> Toggle math panels, since
  it actually does not insert anything and its functionality is covered
  by menu View - > Toolbars -> Math Panels (bug 4765).


* DOCUMENTATION

- Math manual:
  - correct shortcuts for math fonts in section 11.1

  details.

  fails (bug 4638)
