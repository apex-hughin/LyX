Public release of LyX version 2.1.1
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.1.1.  This is the first 
maintenance release in the 2.1.x series.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.1.1 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX 2.1.1 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. We strongly encourage 
all LyX users to upgrade to this version.

Several users have reported seemingly random crashes with 2.1.0, sometimes 
resulting in dataloss. These crashes appear to happen when the user attempts 
to save a file, and the dataloss occurs because the original LyX file is over-
written by a corrupt file that then cannot be opened. The seemingly random
crashes, we believe, are due to auto-save, which is enabled or disabled in
Tools> Preferences> Document Handling > "Backup documents every...minutes".

Unfortunately, we have been unable to find the cause of this bug, though all
known reports seem to involve documents that contain tables, and the corrupt 
file always ends with: \begin_inset Tabular.

To prevent dataloss, we have changed the way LyX saves files if the user
has not enabled backups. LyX now renames the existing file before 
attempting to save the new one (in effect, making a temporary backup). 
Then, if the save fails, the original file can be restored.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.1.1, either e-mail the LyX
developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org) or open a bug
report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.1.1.

The LyX team.

What's new

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- We now flush the output stream more frequently, as a temporary measure
  to help us gather information about the crash mentioned above.

- To prevent dataloss, we have changed the way LyX saves files if the user
  has not enabled backups. LyX now renames the existing file before 
  attempting to save the new one (in effect, making a temporary backup). 
  Then, if the save fails, the original file can be restored.


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Updated Chinese (simplified), French, Interlingua, Japanese, Spanish,
  Swedish and Ukrainian user interface localizations.

We have fixed several significant issues involving conversion of 2.0 format into 
2.1 format, and conversely. This mostly affects the new argument insets and, in 
particular, beamer documents. These are detailed below.

- Fix conversion of beamer blocks with preceding or trailing blanks.

- Add \justification parameter when converting to 2.1 format (avoids
  warning when converting back to 2.0 format).

- Fix "use math package" settings conversion from 2.1 to 2.0 format.

- Fix "use math package" settings conversion from 2.0 to 2.1 format (bug 9069).

- Fix table cell rotation conversion from 2.1 to 2.0 format.

- Fix import of some argument insets.

- Fix some nesting problems in reversion of some beamer environments to 2.0 format.
