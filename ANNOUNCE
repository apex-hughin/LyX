[[[WARNING! THIS IS NOT A REAL ANNOUNCEMENT! LYX 1.3.5 IS NOT RELEASED YET.
   THIS IS JUST A FILE FOR DEVELOPPERS]]

Public release of LyX version 1.3.5
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.5.

This is mainly a bugfix release, with few notable user-visible
improvements. However, we would like to highlight two fixes in particular:

  - Nested documents (with Insert>Include File...), which have been
    broken since LyX 1.2.0, should now work properly, including the
    case where the files are in different directories.

  - It is now possible to compile LyX with gcc 3.4.


The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages
   an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents,
   not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving
   details of visual layout to the software.

   LyX runs on many Unix platforms, OS/2, and under Windows/Cygwin
   (this port requires an X server). It can also run natively on Mac
   OS X, thanks to the Qt/Mac library.

You can download LyX 1.3.5 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.5.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.icm.edu.pl/vol/rzm0/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.5.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.5/

If you already have the LyX 1.3.4 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.5.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.5.bz2


If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.3.5, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users@lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

  Springer Verlag journals for which no specific class exists.

  in 'Instant Preview' of math equations has been re-written in python.
  Windows users now have some chance of getting Instant Preview to

- The built-in Qt dialogs are now correctly translated for the
  languages that Qt supports [Qt >= 3.2 only].

- Make import of the preamble of LaTeX files more robust [bug #1584].

- Fix handling of floats and counters in  svjog and svprobth
  textclasses [bug #1430].

- Fix handling of counters in the scrlettr and scrlttr2 classes.

- Fix off-by-one-error which caused LyX to chose the wrong custom margin
  package.

- Remove extra spaces around math insets in plain text output.

* User Interface:

- Use opening quotation marks after an opening square bracket.

- Fix the toggling of the short title inset in some cases.

- When the autodetection of latex classes cannot be done for some
  reason, provide a sensible list of textclasses.

- Honor correctly the various locale-related environment variables when
  looking for translated help files.

- Prevent activation of the Ok and Apply buttons in the reference
  dialog when simply manipulating the list of references in the dialog.

- Set the default button in the print dialog, activated on Return,
  to be the Ok button rather than the Close button. [bug #1465, Qt only].

- Enable instant preview to work on Solaris machines.

- Fix an annoying "could not delete temp dir" warning.

- Fix some math bindings like "M-m [" for german or french keyboards.

- Don't allow the insertion of incomplete citation references,
  which led to a crash [bug 1617].

- Correct the spelling of the "Acknowledgements" style in the APA layout.

* Configuration/Installation:

- When running under Windows, configure correctly the ps and pdf
  viewers [bug #1508].

- The Qt-related parts of the configure script honors the environment
  variables MOC and UIC if they are set.
