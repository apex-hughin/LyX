Public release of LyX version 1.4.1
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.4.1. This is a bug fix
release, but some of the bugs were big. In particular:

- fix the huge memory consumption and corresponding sluggishness with
  documents containing many graphics or `instant preview' snippets.

- fix the delay when exiting from a math inset. 

- let the change tracking code track paragraph breaks too.

Also, this will be the first 1.4 release with a windows installer.

See the file RELEASE-NOTES for some known problems in this release.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with page
   boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary
   TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output -- or
   richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks like
   nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs, all
   looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes 'eating'
   your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms. 

You can download LyX 1.4.1 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.1.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.4.1.tar.gz

Note that no patch is provided to upgrade from version 1.3.7.

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.4.1/

If you already have the LyX 1.4.0 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.1.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.1.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.4.1, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel  <at>  lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users  <at>  lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.
