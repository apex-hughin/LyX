Public release of LyX version 1.3.7
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.7.

We hope that this will be the last release in the 1.3.x series. In
addition to many bug fixes, the following improvements are worth
noting:

- LyX 1.3.7 is able to read all LyX files up to file format 245,
  the format that we anticipate will be used by the forthcoming LyX 1.4.0.

- The windows version has received some polish, in particular in the
  installer and in the handling of file names.

All current 1.3.x users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with page
   boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary
   TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output -- or
   richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks like
   nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs, all
   looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes 'eating'
   your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux and the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms. 

You can download LyX 1.3.7 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.7.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.3.7.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.7/

If you already have the LyX 1.3.6 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.7.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.7.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Win sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.3.7, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel @ lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users @ lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.


What's new
==========

** Updates

- Update lyx2lyx to handle properly the latest LyX 1.4 format (245).

* User Interface:

- Fix wrong path when drag-and-dropping files on Windows. [Qt only] 

- Fix interaction of LyX with external clipboard (e.g. Klipper) (bug 1976).

- Ensure that no dialogs have one shortcut assigned to more than one action.
  Always connect the OK button to the Alt-O shortcut. [Qt only]

- Ensure that the user cannot create a reference without first selecting
  one in the reference dialog. [Qt only].

- The Return key is no longer bound to the Goto button in the reference
  dialog. [Qt only].

- Double clicking in the reference dialog now inserts a reference
  (bug 2187) [Qt only].

- Searching backwards in the citation dialog always skipped one result
  (bug 2002). Fixed now.

- Do not trim spaces from either end of the find and replace strings in
  the Edit->Find & Replace... dialog. [XForms only].

- Fix crash when trying to display current directory and ${HOME} is empty.

- Add key bindings for "primary-selection-paste".

- Add missing cygwin support file in the distribution (bug 2035).
