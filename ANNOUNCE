Public release of LyX version 1.6.3
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.3. This is the third
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series. Besides the usual improvements
of stability, the highlights of this release are:

* tex2lyx is now able to read files in all latex supported encodings and
  transform them into the proper unicode-based format introduced in 1.5.0.
  This paves the way for many other improvements in LaTeX->LyX translation
* The performance problems when editing a master with child documents have
  been resolved.
* LyX 1.6.3 introduces some goodies provided by Qt 4.5 (menu support for 
  fullscreen mode in linux, close button on tabs). Of course these
  improvements (as well as some Qt-related fixes) only show up if LyX is
  compiled against Qt 4.5.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

All users are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.3 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.3.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.3.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.3.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):
