Public release of LyX version 1.2.3
===================================

We are glad to announce the release of LyX 1.2.3.

LyX 1.2.3 is a maintenance release. It mainly fixes a very bad bug
where configuring LyX as root could lead to deleting the /dev/null
special device (this does not impact users of prebuilt binaries).
Also, a bug where LyX would create zombie processes has been fixed.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

  LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an
  approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
  appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of 
  visual layout to the software.

  LyX runs on many Unix platforms (including MacOS X), OS/2, and under
  Windows/Cygwin. Note that all these ports use the same xforms interface 
  and therefore need an X server. 

The main LyX site is

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/

with mirrors at

        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/
