Public release of LyX version 1.3.6
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.3.6.

Unix and MacOSX users should consider this to be a bugfix release.

To Windows users, however, LyX 1.3.6 is the first version of LyX
to support the platform officially. This means that we've put a huge
effort into squashing those bugs that were present in Ruurd Reitsma's
unofficial ports to Windows. Large chunks of the code base have been
touched in an attempt to resolve these problems so whilst we're
confident that LyX/Win 1.3.6 will be the best ever version of LyX on
Windows, we cannot say that it's bug free.

We would like to highlight three fixes in particular:
  * It is now possible to typeset files which reside in a directory with
    spaces in its name; this requires a modern TeX implementation (such
    as teTeX 3.0).
  * It is possible to use Ctrl-PageDown and Control-PageUp (<cmd>-tab
    and <cmd>-backtab with Qt/Mac) to switch between the open documents.
  * LaTeX-type accents, ligature breaks and hyphenation marks are now
    considered as part of words 

The complete list of improvements and fixes can be found at the end of
this message.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages
   an approach to writing based on the structure of your documents,
   not their appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving
   details of visual layout to the software.

   LyX was originally a Unix application, but now runs natively on
   Windows and Mac OS X as well, thanks largely to the cross-platform Qt
   toolkit.

You can download LyX 1.3.6 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.3.6.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/other/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.3.6.tar.gz


Prebuilt binaries (mainly rpms for linux distributions) should soon be
available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.3.6/

If you already have the LyX 1.3.5 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.6.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.3.6.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Win sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.3.6, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel @ lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users @ lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.
