Public release of LyX version 2.1.2
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.1.2.  This is the first 
maintenance release in the 2.1.x series.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.1.1 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX 2.1.2 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. We strongly encourage 
all LyX users to upgrade to this version.

The most important fix here is that we believe we have resolved the problem 
that led several users to experience seemingly random crashes with 2.1.0, 
sometimes resulting in dataloss. (This was bug 9049.) These crashes generally 
happened when the user attempted to save a file containing a table, usually a 
fairly complex table. A seemingly unrelated bug report concerning a crash when 
trying to save a default template (bug 9236) led to the solution. That bug has
also been fixed.

Do report your bugs, then! It really does help make LyX better, often in ways 
you might not expect.

So, if you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.1.2, open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.1.2.

The LyX team.
