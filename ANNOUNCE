Public release of LyX version 1.4.4
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.4.4. This is a bug fix
release that improves stability and MS Windows support.
Notable new features include:

- Outline support: it is now possible to move around parts of
  documents in the Table of Contents dialog.

- Add new UI settings default-autotoolbars and default-alltoolbars
  allowing to select what toolbars are active or shown automatically.

- Improved documentation.

- Speed improvments, especially on windows.


See the file RELEASE-NOTES for some known problems in this release.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with page
   boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's legendary
   TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output -- or
   richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks like
   nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs, all
   looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes 'eating'
   your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms. 

You can download LyX 1.4.4 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.4.4.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will also host
the .bz2 versions):

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz
        ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/publishing/tex/lyx/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz
        ftp://ftp.ntua.gr/pub/X11/LyX/stable/lyx-1.4.4.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.4.4/

If you already have the LyX 1.4.3 sources, you may want to apply one
of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.4.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/patch-1.4.4.bz2

Note that this patch will not produce valid LyX/Mac sources, since
some binary files have been added for this release.

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.4.4, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel  <at>  lists.lyx.org), or open
a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a question,
first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find the answer there,
e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users  <at>  lists.lyx.org).

Enjoy!

The LyX team.

***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Convert included vector graphics to pdf instead of png for pdflatex export
  (bug 2868). This is implemented with the help of a new format flag "vector"
  that you have to set manually for your self defined vector graphics formats
  if you want to use this feature.

- Add a wmf -> eps converter (bug 2845) and a latex -> rtf converter.

- Add the layout file and an example document for the beamer
  presentation class (these files where taken from the beamer package
  by Till Tantau); new layout file ISPRS (Int. Soc. Photogrammetry &
  Remote Sensing); new layout file for Arabic articles; update layout
  file for REVTeX4 (bug 1215)

  documents in the Table of Contents dialog.

- Add new UI settings default-autotoolbars and default-alltoolbars
  allowing to select what toolbars are active.

  layout of the text class. This is used by a new button "Default" in the
  extra toolbar.

- Add a menu entry for numbered formulas (bug 2901).

- Updates to the european keyboard map (useful for entering accented
  characters on a qwerty keyboard).

* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

  in English and Spanish. It describes in detail tables, graphics,

  Italian, Romanian and Spanish localization of the interface.

  Tutorial); Update German (all), Hebrew (Intro), Italian
  (Tutorial, UserGuide), and Spanish (Intro) documentation.


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Write inherited colors correctly as "inherit" to the .lyx file. Previously

- Parse the optional argument of the AMS math environments aligned, gathered
  and alignedat.

- Support lgathered and rgathered math environments.

- Fix import of \fullcite commands from LaTeX.

- Update bibliography references when the entry has been changed (bug
  2744).

- The BibTeX style files (bst files) can now live in paths with spaces
  (bug 2186).

- Fixed undo-and-TOC-navigation bug.

- Fixed layout2layout (spurious tabs), so layout files from 1.3 can be read 
  again.

- Revert fix from 1.4.3 for better display of script insets with a nucleus
  with more than one element (like {a'}^{2}), since it was buggy and it is
  very difficult to do it right (bug 2921).

- Re-enable Address paragraph style in AMS article classes (bug 2890).

- Write \begin and \end alignment tags on their own lines (bug 3010).

  it cannot be omitted.

  dialog (bug 3063) [qt only].

  mode (bug 2865).

  and 2933).

- Fix an undo crash crash with nested font changes in math (bug 3019).

- Clear label when a formula is unnumbered (bug 2556).

- Disallow pressing the add button in the citation dialog when no citations
  are available, preventing a crash (bug 3057).

- Fix deletion of empty paragraph in various situations: paragraphs
  with different layouts, layouts with KeepEmpty property, ERT insets,
  tabular cells (bugs 2587 and 2882).

- fix bug where icons remain disabled after opening a dialog (bug
  2877).

- when a dialog is open in LyX/Mac, make sure that the menu entries
  that do not make sense are disabled (bug 1720).

  the Finder uses.

- The natbib labels weren't always displayed correctly when opening
  a document. This is fixed.

- Allow double values for graphics' bounding box parameters again
  (bug 3055). This also fixes problems with older LyX files
  (bug 3066) [qt only].

- Rename lib/ui/std*.ui include files to *.inc so that the user is not
  tempted to try them (bug 2387).

- add Aspell/Pspell's file extension for personal dictionary files
  in preferences (bug 895)
