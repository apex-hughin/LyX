Public release of LyX version 1.5.7
====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.7. This is the sixth
maintenance release in the 1.5.x cycle and it is expected to be the final
release in this series, since a new series of stable releases has just been
introduced by our new major release, LyX 1.6.0. Besides the obligatory bug
fixes, the main feature of this release is the ability to read files created
by LyX 1.6.0 (this feature requires python 2.3.4 or newer).

All users who intend to stick with the 1.5.x series for the time being are
encouraged to upgrade to this version.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.7 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.5.x/lyx-1.5.7.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.5.x/lyx-1.5.7.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.7.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.5.7.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/1.5.x/lyx-1.5.7.tar.gz

installers) should soon be available at
