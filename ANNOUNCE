Public release of LyX version 1.5.2
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.5.2. This is a maintenance
release that focuses on improving the stability. We have fixed numerous
crashes, performance problems, and other bugs. Furthermore, the documentation
has been revised. It covers all new features of the 1.5.x series now.

A detailed list of changes is appended below. The file RELEASE-NOTES lists
some remaining known problems.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software / Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.5.2 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

What's new in version 1.5.2?
----------------------------

** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- The LyX User Guide has been revised completely. It is now up to
  date and describes all of LyX 1.5's main features (bug 3315 a.o.)
  For a detailed changelog, see
  http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/DocumentationDevelopment#Status

- The LyX User Guide has been translated into Spanish.

- The Embedded Objects manual contains two new sections:
  * longtable alignment.
  * scaled and rotated material.

- Many improvements to the translation of the user interface on the Mac.
  In particular, LyX automatically uses the language of the interface for
  all of its menus and for the help files. Documents strings like
  "Chapter" are correctly translated on screen too.

- New translations of the user interface into Finnish, Portuguese and
  Simplified Chinese.

- Updated Czech and Italian translations of the user interface.

* USER INTERFACE

- Add a pixmap cache to speed up text drawing on screen. This cache is
  enabled on Mac and Windows platforms using Qt 4.2 or higher.

- Add an optimization that avoids a full screen drawing when typing in a
  non-wide inset.

- Add a "Save all" menu entry, to save all modified files (bug 2840).

- Mark modified files in the View menu with an asterisk (bug 2876).

- Add a paragraph-params LFUN, used for updating paragraph parameters
  (bug 2714).

- Add a "Save all on log-out or cancel" feature (bug 1656).

- Improved on screen rendering of some toolbar images.

- The dialogs of "editable" insets (such as index entries, URLs or
  citations) are now opened by the "next-inset-toggle" LFUN (bug
  2907).

- The screen label of index insets now displays their content.

- Floats comes now with fixed width on screen (bug 4002).

- A "Title (Plain Frame)" style has been added to the beamer layout.
  This allows for setting a title frame without head-/footlines and
  navigation bars (bug 3133).

- The AMS document classes have undergone a major rewrite. Several
  bugs were fixed and some new styles were added (bugs 4087, 4223).
  Cf. http://wiki.lyx.org/Layouts/AMS for a detailed list of changes.

- New LyX functions, master-buffer-view and master-buffer-update, have
  been added, to view the master buffer associated with a given child
  buffer. These are bound by default to C-M-t and C-M-d, for Postscript
  and DVI, respectively, for view, and to C-M-S-t and C-M-S-d, for update.

- The debug output obtained with the '-dbg painting' option has been
  modified to be more verbose and in line with the LyX development
  version.

** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Reconfiguration failure will no longer result in empty textclass lists.
  Lyx now starts and asks for reconfigure if no textclass is found (bug 2829).

- Check if the .lyx file has been externally modified when a buffer is saved.

- Fix conversion from older documents if koi8 is used as the document
  encoding (bug 4158).

- Handle array column specifiers @{decl.}, p{width} and the extensions by
  array.sty in mathed (bug 4132).

- Detect (pdf)tex's file:line:error style messages that are used by some
  distributions and that caused LyX to ignore LaTeX errors (bug 4222).

- Fix LaTeX error with captions in Program Listings (bug 4182).

* USER INTERFACE:

- Fix a crash when closing a LyX window with document tabs (bug 4123).

- Fix a crash when clicking in a tabular cell and the "delete empty paragraph"
  mechanism triggers (bug 4133).

- Fix a crash when using the LFUN 'buffer-write-as' with an argument
  that is not an absolute path (bug 4135).

- Fix a crash when a user removes the underlying figure of a graphic inset
  that has been copied and pasted (bug 4108).

- Fix a crash when inserting a float.

- Fix a crash on quitting if graphics were selected (bug 4178).

- Fix a crash when a user removes a formula when its preview is being
  generated (gcc 3 only).

- Fix a crash when using the down arrow in an empty math subscript (bug 4117).

- Fix a crash when logging out from within the Gnome desktop (bug 1656).

- Fix a crash when exporting a file with graphics to LaTeX on Windows
  (bug 4243).

  compiled with gcc's stdlib-debug option (bug 4014).

- Fix performance problem related to Clipboard and Selection on X11
  platforms (bug 4045).

- Only update the toolbars that are actually visible. This improves LyX's
  performance on editing.

- Further improve performance on editing by reducing the update calls of the
  math panel toolbar to the bare essentials.

- Fix the loading of non-LyX child documents with relative path names. Change
  'Load' to 'Edit' in the child document dialog (bugs 4107 and 4111).

- Allow roman numerals beyond 20 (bug 4112).

- Render malformed tables correctly (bug 580).

- Enable File>Revert when the file is externally modified, and rename
  this menu item to "File>Revert to saved" (bugs 3766 and 4114).

- Update the screen when leaving a 'wide' inset using the up- and down-arrows.

- Fix a problem where the Delete button in the citation dialog was erroneously
  disabled (bug 4121).

- Reset the current cursor font when going to a bookmark.

- Fix an icorrect handling of spaces in change tracking mode (bug 3961).

- Fix a failure to close the window when a modified document is saved
  (bug 4170).

- Highlight search text in the find dialog (bug 3999).

- Fix the deletion of paragraphs with leading spaces (bug 3600).

- Fix the loss of start-of-appendix information when creating/deleting an
  empty paragraph (bug 4212).

- "Revert" and "Save As" are no longer treated as external modifications
  of the document (bug 4193).

- Fix a bug where the "longest label" widget in the paragraph dialog was
  disabled after its content was deleted (bug 4127).

- Fix a bug where the cursor was largely off-screen on document opening
  (bug 3427).

- Fix a bug where fixed width insets were not honoured correctly (bug 4029).

- Fix a bug where the current document was closed unexpectedly when
  typing a space after switching between 2 documents with the file->Open
  dialog (bug 4211).

- Fix bug in box dialog where the inner box was empty when switching
  the box decoration (bug 4233).


* DOCUMENTATION

- Fix installation links for Hebrew (bug 4165).

- Correct the description of list of algorithms in the Embedded Objects manual.

- Fix the appearance of the word "LyX" in PDF-bookmarks in the
  Introduction manual (bug 2435).

- removed description of the program "reLyX" that was replaced in LyX 1.4 by
  "tex2lyx" (bug 2766)


* BUILD/INSTALLATION:

- Upgrade to boost 1.34.1.

- Upgrade to gettext 0.14.6.

- On all supported platforms, allow Qt 4.2 or higher to use the math fonts in
  <sysdir>/fonts without the need to install them.

- Make configure.py remove a log file generated by MikTeX and copy the file
  chkconfig.ltx to the user dir using default permissions (thus avoiding a
  bug on Cygwin where python doesn't copy ACLs associated with a file).

- Clarify an error message for --without-included-boost.

- Better alignment of the version info output.

- Remove the /TP (force to use C++ compiler) option from scons/msvc.

- Allow the use of a snapshot version of scons.

- Fix usage display for lib/doc_toc.py (bug 3798).
