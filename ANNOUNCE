Public release of LyX version 1.6.4
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.4. This is the fourth
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series. This release covers, amongst
many minor improvements, fixes to some rather severe issues, such as:

* A workaround to a nasty problem in recent Qt versions (Qt 4.5.0 up to
  4.5.2) that made LyX crash if the document included images that were
  scaled to certain sizes in the work area.
* Fixes to problems that might result in the loss of data.
* Many other stability improvements, thanks to a new debugging script that
  helped to reveal uncovered critical bugs.
* Further fixes to the LaTeX importer (tex2lyx) and the conversion of
  older LyX documents (lyx2lyx).

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

All users and distributors are urged to upgrade to this version.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.4 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.4.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.4.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.4.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.4.tar.gz

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.4.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.6.4/

If you already have the sources of the previous release, you may want to apply
one of the following patches instead

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/patch-1.6.4.bz2

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.6.4, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org
