Public release of LyX version 2.0.5
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.5. This is the fourth
maintenance release in the 2.0.x series.

LyX 2.0.5 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. We encourage all
LyX users to upgrade to this version.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is

developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org), or open a bug
report at http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at

users' list (lyx-users at lists.lyx.org).

What's new in LyX 2.0.5
=======================

The View>Source widget now allows you to select the backend to display,
e.g., LaTeX or XHTML, rather than the output format. The previous choice
really made no sense: You didn't see a PDF there if you chose one of the
PDF output formats, but rather LaTeX. This solves some long-standing issues
with View>Source.
