Public release of LyX version 2.1.1
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.1.1.  This is the first 
maintenance release in the 2.1.x series.

LyX 2.1.1 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
even more reliable and stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made
a number of improvements. These are detailed below. We strongly encourage 
all LyX users to upgrade to this version.

Several users have reported seemingly random crashes with 2.1.0, sometimes 
resulting in dataloss. These crashes appear to happen when the user attempts 
to save a file, and the dataloss occurs because the original LyX file is over-
written by a corrupt file that then cannot be opened. The seemingly random
crashes, we believe, are due to auto-save, which is enabled or disabled in
Tools> Preferences> Document Handling > "Backup documents every...minutes".

Unfortunately, we have been unable to find the cause of this bug, though all
known reports seem to involve documents that contain tables, and the corrupt 
file always ends with: \begin_inset Tabular. Users who work with tables a lot
may therefore wish to disable auto-save.

To prevent dataloss, we have changed the way LyX saves files. Rather than
over-write the original file immediately, LyX now saves the new file to a
temporary name and then renames the new file to the original filename only
after it has been written successfully. 

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.
