This file describes what has been done in the preparation of LyX 1.6.5
All comments are welcome.

I'd be glad if some of you could take the time to check it out (or fix
a bug or two if you are feeling adventurous). Let me recall that all
these fixes have been checked into the BRANCH_1_6_X branch, which you
can get with the command
  svn co svn://svn.lyx.org/lyx/lyx-devel/branches/BRANCH_1_6_X lyx-1.6.x

** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Do an emergency save if LyX attempts to destroy a dirty document buffer.
  This is a last resort to try to avoid data loss.

- Fix support for polytonic Greek with multiple diacritics (bug 5976).

- Do not unnecessarily enquote brackets in the LaTeX output (bug 5988).


* USER INTERFACE

- Sort document classes case insensitively (bug 1492).

- Disable to insert floats into another float when this is not
  allowed (bug 6045).
  
- Disable the float positioning dialog for subfloats (bug 6125).

- Do not close the cross references dialog when selecting an item from the
  list (UNIX only; bug 6204).

- The menu item "Close Tab Group" is renamed to "Close Current View" to
  better relate this to the action "Split View ..." (bug 5067).

- Fix a bug that the keymap settings in the Preferences dialog could
  not be deleted (bug 6119).

- Fix a number of small issues regarding menu items and menu shortcuts
  (bug 6164).

- Fix a bug that it was possible to request the wrong context menu
  by moving the mouse during the right-click (bug 5796).

- Fix the painting of RTL text. All rows except the last one of a
  paragraph were painted slightly too far to the left (bug 3997).
