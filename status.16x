This file describes what has been done in the preparation of LyX 1.6.6
All comments are welcome.

I'd be glad if some of you could take the time to check it out (or fix
a bug or two if you are feeling adventurous). Let me recall that all
these fixes have been checked into the BRANCH_1_6_X branch, which you
can get with the command
  svn co svn://svn.lyx.org/lyx/lyx-devel/branches/BRANCH_1_6_X lyx-1.6.x

What's new
==========


** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- LyX now supports SVG images when either the librsvg library or
  or Inkscape (version 0.47 recommended) is installed (bug 3349).

- LaTeX import (tex2lyx) now recognizes the types of quotes dependent
  on the document language. (When importing e.g. a Spanish document,
  LyX will use comillas latinas as quotes.)

- Add support for Aspell language varieties. This enables proper support
  of German old and new spelling in parallel when "aspell (library)" is
  used (bug 4657).

- Add support for the enchant spellchecker (bug 6226). LyX needs to be
  compiled --with-enchant in order to use this feature.


* USER INTERFACE

- Checking all opened files for external change after updating from SVN
  repository (part of bug 5211).

- Add a Close All menu item to the menu (bug 740).

- Toolbar entry for the AMS math symbol \Diamond added.

- All importable file types can now be dragged and dropped onto
  LyX to open them (bug 2948).

- Use a standard (rather than a wait) mouse cursor when displaying alerts.

- <Enter> in empty enumerations and other environments decreases depth if
  possible and otherwise resets the layout to standard.


* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- New Spanish translations of the beamer and tufte example files.

- The dinbrief and g-brief-de layouts were translated to English.

- The dinbrief template was revised.

- Updated User's Guide and EmbeddedObjects manual.

- Updated Math manual: description how to change font size within
  formulas in sec. 11.4.

- Updated Czech, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Russian, Slovak
  and Spanish user interface localization.

- The rpm README file was updated.


* WINDOWS INSTALLER



* BUILD/INSTALLATION

- Add support for Cygwin 1.7.

- Update Cygwin configuration files.


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

  (bug 6388).

  language (bug 6387).

- Make reverse dvi/pdf search work even when the temporary dir contains
  spaces (common to all platforms, but particularly important on Windows).

  in mathed (bug 6437).

  crashed LyX (bug 6459).
  
- Fix a stdlib assertion when deleting from an ERT in math (bug 6489).

- Fix on-screen display of author names containing a thin space
  (such as W.\,H. Auden).

- Take into account the current zoom factor, dip, or preview scale
  factor when an instant preview is generated.

  to the font of that cell.
