This file describes what has been done in the preparation of LyX 1.5.3
All comments are welcome.

I'd be glad if some of you could take the time to check it out (or fix
a bug or two if you are feeling adventurous). Let me recall that all
these fixes have been checked into the BRANCH_1_5_X branch, which you
can get with the command
  svn co svn://svn.lyx.org/lyx/lyx-devel/branches/BRANCH_1_5_X lyx-1.5.x

What's new
==========


** Updates:
***********

* DOCUMENTATION AND LOCALIZATION

- Update Japanese, Spanish and Traditional Chinese translations of the 
  interface

- Spanish translation of the example file "ItemizeBullets.lyx"


* USER INTERFACE

- the behaviour of Return and M-Return has changed: they now allow to either
  keep current paragraph and depth or to to nesting paragraph (bug 2445).

- Add the esint font to the private math fonts. This font assures a
  consistent on screen looking for all kinds of supported integral signs.

- The slides/foils of presentation classes such as beamer, powerdot, foils
  and slides are now displayed in the outliner. This makes it easy to navigate
  to specific slides or move them up and down (bug 78).

- It is now possible to enter greek and cyrillic characters and have them
  typesetted without switching to the proper language.


** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix a crash when exporting a file with a branch from the command line
  (bug 4255).

- Remove obsolete LaTeX-preamble code that was set when a document contains
  URLs (bug 2265).

- Add Erlang support for listings (bug 4263).

- Fix LaTeX output when using layouts like Definition but not using
  also Theorem (bug 4282).

- Fix support for the upper Sorbian language.


* USER INTERFACE:

- Repair wasy font such that it can also be used on Mac (bug 2326).

- Fix color of some math symbols (bug 2330).

- Correctly adjust screen fonts when the zoom or dpi settings are changed in
  the preferences.

- Check and show proper error message if configure.py fails (part of bug 2829).

- Do not display the type of charstyle insets by default. Display type of
  an charstyle inset under mouse in the status line.

- Fix DraftDVI preference settings (Windows only).

- Fix problem with backup directory on Windows (bug 4287).

  account by LyX (bug 3172).


* DOCUMENTATION

- Fix wrong character in the User's Guide (including the translations).

- Remove the obsolete example file "currency.lyx" and its German translation
  "Waehrungen.lyx" because one can since LyX 1.5.0 insert currency symbols
  directly.

- Remove the now obsolete German example file "TabellenBeispiel.lyx" because
  its content is described in the EmbeddedObjects manual that is available
  also in German since LyX 1.5.2


* BUILD/INSTALLATION:

- Fix installation of the Spanish User's Guide when building with scons.

- Fix configure.py such that all possible extensions for executables are
  taken into account when searching for programs (Windows only).
