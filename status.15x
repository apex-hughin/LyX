This file describes what has been done in the preparation of LyX 1.5.5
All comments are welcome.

I'd be glad if some of you could take the time to check it out (or fix
a bug or two if you are feeling adventurous). Let me recall that all
these fixes have been checked into the BRANCH_1_5_X branch, which you
can get with the command
  svn co svn://svn.lyx.org/lyx/lyx-devel/branches/BRANCH_1_5_X lyx-1.5.x

** Bug fixes:
*************

* DOCUMENT INPUT/OUTPUT

- Fix drawing of top and bottom rules in formal tables (bug 4554).

- Fix reversion of OHM and ANGSTROM characters to LyX < 1.5.0 (rest of
  bug 3313).

- Check for the LaTeX packages "nicefrac" and "units" that are used by
  LyX.

- Check for PDF->PS, PDF->EPS and PS->EPS converters and use them (bug
  3968).

- Stop warning messages when a local layout file is opened. Fix bugs
  caused by incorrect reloading of local layout files.

- Use verbose htlatex command instead of oolatex, if available, since the
  latter caused problems on some systems (bug 4604).

- Assure amsthm is loaded if a theorem is defined with \theoremstyle.

- Close font macros (such as \emph) before comments, greyedout, framed
  and shaded notes, thus fixing a problem where documents couldn't be
  compiled anymore.

- Fix LaTeX error "unknown color 'ignore'" when setting text style
  attributes in mathed (bug 4091).


* USER INTERFACE:

- Allow deleting a label in a formula with the delete key (bug 2556).

- Allow to enter starred math commands such as \tag* (bug 4584).

- Load amsmath when \tag or \tag* is used (bug 4586).

- Fix parameter input of the math commands \makebox and \framebox (bug
  2461).

- When cutting a selection do not leave a dangling paragraph (bug 3995).

- Improve the behaviour when inserting a collapsable inset over a multi-
  paragraph selection.

- Fix the automatic uncollapsing of outliner during updates (bug 3740).

- Remove the menu entries to swap rows/columns as this feature is not
  implemented.


* DOCUMENTATION

- Math manual:
  - correct shortcuts for math fonts in section 11.1
  - fix the description of the command \tag in section 19.4


* BUILD/INSTALLATION:
