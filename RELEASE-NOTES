Known issues with version 1.4.4
--------------------------------

This section describes some known problems in LyX 1.4.4 that did not
occur in 1.3.7. Note that fixes are available for many of these, but
they have not yet been applied because of incomplete testing. 

** User Interface

- Font changes do not apply to tables inside the selection when
  making latex.

Interface changes since 1.3.x
-----------------------------

Some of the LyX functions have changed names :

tab-insert -> cell-split
tab-backward -> cell-backward
tab-forward -> cell-forward

Additionally, tab-forward (bound to the "Tab" key normally) no
longer has any effect in normal text.

bibkey-insert -> bibitem-insert

bibtex-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset bibtex
citation-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset citation
external-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset external
graphics-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset graphics
buffer-child-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset include
reference-insert -> dialog-show-new-inset ref

These LyX functions have been removed entirely :

apropos
server-get-tip
math-greek
math-greek-toggle
