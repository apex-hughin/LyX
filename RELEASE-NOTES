This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 1.5.6, some 
known problems in LyX 1.5.6 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 1.5.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Known issues in version 1.5.6
------------------------------------

- Unicode characters are generally not yet supported in mathed. If you insert
  a special character to a math formula, the output of the document will
  silently fail. Support for unicode in mathed will be introduced in the next
  major release, LyX 1.6.0.

- If you are using a local layout file (i.e., a *.layout file that resides in
  the same directory as the document), and if you are saving the document to
  another directory, the class information of the document get lost unless
  you also copy the layout file to the new directory manually.
  Cf. http://bugzilla.lyx.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4812.

- If KDE 4.0 (the kdelibs4 package, for that matter) is installed, LyX might
  crash when previewing an EPS graphic (or any other graphic that is converted
  via EPS). This is a bug in the kdelibs package (the kimg_eps library, to be
  precise) included in the KDE 4 pre-releases and in KDE 4.0. The problem has
  been resolved for KDE 4.0.1. We encourage all affected KDE 4 users to upgrade 
  to KDE 4.0.1 (or newer).

  If you have to stick with KDE 4.0 for some reason, there are two workarounds:
  * uninstall kdelibs4 (or KDE4, for that matter) or
  * disable graphics preview in Tools->Preferences->Graphics
  Cf. http://bugzilla.lyx.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4409
  and
  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=156957

- Cursor restoration problems with Multiple-View:
  When using multiple Windows to edit different parts of the same document,
  the cursor position is sometimes not correctly restored when you switch 
  from one view to the other.

- RTL and keymaps:
  Currently there is a bug where you can't use two non-RTL language keymaps if
  the RTL preference is set (which is now the default). If you need to use two
  non-RTL keymaps, for now you should just turn off the RTL preference (Tools ->
  Preferences... -> Language settings -> Language, uncheck "Right-to-left
  language support").
  We hope to offer more comprehensive support for multiple keymaps in the future,
  which will solve this bug, as well as allow more than just two keymaps. If you 
  have any input on this issue, please chime in on the developers mailing list,
  or add your comments to http://bugzilla.lyx.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4051.


Interface changes as of version 1.5.4
--------------------------------------

- Due to a license conflict, the LaTeX-package "floatflt" that is used by LyX
  for wrap figure floats has been removed from all major LaTeX-distributions.
  Thus, we were forced to switch to the package "wrapfig". As consequence of this,
  the look and positioning of wrap floats in your documents might slightly differ.
  Please backup documents with wrap floats before upgrading and check the output.


Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 1.5.x
-------------------------------------------------------

Due to the change to Unicode, there are some general things you'll have to take care
about when upgrading from an older version to LyX 1.5.0 or newer. Please refer to the
file UPGRADING for details.
